# Google Analytics integration plugin

This plugin adds Google Analytics tracking and reporting features to the [OctoberCMS](http://octobercms.com).

## Configuration

### Configure the API

To get started using Google Analytics API, you need to first [create or select a project in the Google Developers Console and enable the API](https://console.developers.google.com//start/api?id=analytics&credential=client_key). Using this link guides you through the process and activates the Google Analytics API automatically.

Alternatively, you can activate the Google Analytics API yourself in the Developers Console by doing the following:

1. Open the [Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential).

In either case, you end up on the **Credentials** page and can create your project's credentials from here.

#### Create a client ID

1. Open the [**Service accounts** section](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/permissions/serviceaccounts) of the Developers Console's **Permissions** page.

1. Click **Create service account**.

1. In the **Create service account** window, type a name for the service account, eg: `OctoberCMS Analytics`.

1. Place a tick in the box  **Furnish a new private key** and select **P12** for the **Key type**.

1. Place a tick in **Enable Google Apps Domain-wide Delegation** and enter the website name for the **Product name for the consent screen**.

1. Then, click **Create**.

1. A `.p12` file will be generated, this is the private key for your account. Accept the download and save it to your computer.

1. Click **Close**.

1. Select the **Permissions tab** and copy to your clipboard the email address ending with `@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.

### Configure Google Analytics

1. In a new tab, navigate to the main [Google Analytics site](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/) and select the property you want to track.

1. Click the **Admin** main menu tab at the top. Select the **Property > User Management** menu item.

1. *Paste the email address from the clipboard* in to the field **Add permissions for** and make sure the permission is set to **Read & Analyse**. Click **Add**.

1. Click the **Admin** main menu tab again and select **Account > Account Settings** from the menu. *Copy to your clipboard* the Account ID (should be a number).

### Configure October back-end area

1. Open your October back-end administration area and open **Settings > Google Analytics**. 

1. Enter the name of the Google Developers Project in the **Google API project name** field, eg: `OctoberCMS Analytics`.

1. *Paste the Account ID from the clipboard* in to the field **Analytics View/Profile ID number**.

1. Enter the email address (ending with `@developer.gserviceaccount.com`) in the **Email address** field.

1. Upload the previously downloaded `.p12` private key file to the **Private key** field.

1. Specify the **Tracking ID** (eg `UA-12312312-3`) and **Domain name** values if you are going to use the plugin's built-in tracking component. To find this code, select **Admin > Property > Property Settings** from the Google Analytics menu.

1. If Tracking is not working initially, enter the value `auto` for the **Domain name** field. This is a fix for newborn Google Analytics accounts.

## Adding the tracking code

Using the tracking code provided by the plugin is optional - the reporting part does not depend on whether you track your traffic with the built-in tracker or with a custom code generated by Google Analytics tools. 

To add the plugin's tracking code to your website just drop the Google Analytics Tracker component to your CMS layout and add this code to the layout code after the page tag:

```php
{% page %}
{% component 'googleTracker' %}
```
